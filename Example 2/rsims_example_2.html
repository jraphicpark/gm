Robert Sims - Web Dev Candidate - Example 2

JS and Jquery (Loops, Dom manipulation, User based actions)

- Create an array of 20 strings (names, songs, birds, phrases...anything). 

- Using jquery, display each string as a numbered list on the page. 

- Every third string should be bolded, every 5th string should be italicized, and every even numbered string should have a black border around it. 

- If a user clicks on an even numbered string, that string should be removed from the list.

*****************************************************************
DEV NOTES:

Not sure if this was intended by the test crafter, but if an even item is clicked and removed, the item directly below becomes an even item, and all items below shift up one spot.  This script accounts for the shift and re-styles the list, including adding the removal feature to the newly shifted even items.
